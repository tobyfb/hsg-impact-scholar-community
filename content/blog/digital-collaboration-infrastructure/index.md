There was an obvious interest during the kick-off in using digital tools and platforms as part of the HSG Impact Scholar Community. Many tools were discussed! ðŸ˜Š 

Different tools and platforms have different strengths and weaknesses, and different people have different preferences. Our approach would therefore be to **test out a few alternatives and see what sticks**. 

We set up [Discourse](https://www.social-innovation.community/c/hsg-impact-scholar-community/6) (not to be confused with Discord!), [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l7CqNSE=/), and a [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9079003/) as a starting point. We think that Discourse is great for in-depth conversations and structuring/linking content, Miro provides a great way to visually present some content and interact during virtual workshops, and LinkedIn is already used by everybody.

*Please feel free to introduce yourself on Discourse and/or Miro and/or LinkedIn! And we warmly invite you to make these platforms your own: suggest formats and topics for future meetings of the HSG Impact Scholar Community, find your co-author or research buddy, post links to cool articles,â€¦* ðŸ¤—

From the discussions during the kick-off, there might be a place for dedicated document storage (such as Sharepoint, Dropbox, Google Drive) and real-time communication (such as Teams, Slack, WhatsApp, Signal, â€¦). Sharepoint and Teams have the advantage of easily being available to all of us through HSG.

The discussion of digital communication and collaboration infrastructures will likely be an ongoing discussion in future meetings. If you feel strongly about a tool or platform and would be willing to help setting it up and moderate, please [**reach out**](/contact/)!
