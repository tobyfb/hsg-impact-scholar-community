The "HSG Impact Scholar Community" connects scholars aiming to conduct research that positively contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and fosters positive social and environmental change. We are a local initiative at HSG, inspired by initiatives such as the [AOM Impact Scholar Community](https://www.impactscholarcommunity.com). We want to create connections and synergies across institutes (breaking the silos), strengthening a collaborative HSG research culture. Let’s exchange, collaborate, develop cool things, learn from and support each other!

The community is jointly initiated by early career researchers at the Competence Center for Social Innovation (CSI-HSG), the Institute of Management and Strategy (IfB) and the Institute for Economy and the Environment (IWÖ). It facilitates mutual exchange and learning on how to create impact on society and the natural environment. We provide a space for dialogue, connect people in the HSG ecosystem and live a culture of sharing knowledge and experiences. We co-create joint activities such as informal gatherings, skill development workshops and academic networking.

Program and formats will be developed by the community. We plan to have regular meetings both in person and virtual. Possible formats could include:

- Skills development workshops (e.g. on methods, action research) 
- Discussion of innovative research designs 
- Research talks and seminars 
- Career stories and talks 
- Paper presentations and discussions 
- Peer to peer sounding board/reviews (shitty first drafts) 
- Science slam sessions 
- Video series on impactful research 
- Exchange with alumni interested or working in sustainability and social innovation 

Are you an (early career) researcher focusing on social or environmental innovation, grand challenges, sustainability, responsibility, (business) ethics, systems thinking or related topics? Reach out to the founding members listed below to stay in the loop! You will then be invited to our next upcoming gatherings!
