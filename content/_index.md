description: The HSG Impact Scholar Community connects scholars aiming to conduct research that positively contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and fosters positive social and environmental change. </br></br>Both the concept and the name of our local community was inspired by the [Impact Scholar Community](https://www.impactscholarcommunity.com) (see our [initial call for collaboration](https://impact-scholar.community/blog/2021-05-06_initial-invitation/)) which was established in 2020 and is supported by the Academy of Management (AOM) and hosted by the Organization and the Natural Environment AOM division.
